All development (both new features and bug fixes) is performed in `develop` branch. This way `master` sources always contain sources of the most recently released version. Please send PRs with bug fixes to `develop` branch. Fixes to documentation in markdown files are an exception to this rule. They are updated directly in `master`.

The `develop` branch is pushed to `master` during release.
